Do geo_aquisition_source and geo_aquisition_type belong in the 
	spatial linking table, or in the origin table or the reference table?
	What are the data types for these tables?
** Should be attached to well/borehole/outcrop
** Just text

Can geo_aquisition_source/type be replaced with a note of a specific type?
	If no, why not?

Can we use place instead of region, since we can just apply the type of
	"region" to a place? If no, why not?

Is region the same as the regions listed in mining district?
